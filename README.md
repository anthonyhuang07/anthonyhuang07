# Hello! 👋

My name is Anthony Huang. I'm a 14 year old programmer who mostly focuses on **front-end things**, mostly web development. I know HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript and learning Python. I hope to become a full-stack engineer in the future, but I'll have to learn some back-end stuff first.
