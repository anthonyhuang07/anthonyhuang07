# 👋 Hello!

My name is Anthony Huang. I'm a 14 year old programmer who mostly focuses on **front-end things**, mostly web development. I know HTML, CSS, JavaScript and a bit of C. I hope to become a full-stack engineer in the future, but I'll have to learn some back-end stuff first. 

Please visit my website any time to learn more about me!
